# Smart Social Smart News

## Highest Priority Considerations

## Specification Details

There are many ways to consume news and current information. The challenge here is connecting any one event to a series of events unfolding in a story arc, connceting events in or near a particular location over time, and tracking directly and indirectly-related pieces of information to help maintain an informed populace.

Case in point, at the time of the preparation of this overview, water levels at Lake Mead are continuing to decline, and while daily and even hourly weather reports are commonplace, this vital resource is report on as though it were a comet or cicada hatching. Connecting news updates about water levels to other related news events is a simple, yet highly apprpriate example.
