# Smart Social Project Specification

The Smart Social project is composed of several components, each ideally developed on a platform that serves the required function and performance, and which can interoperate with other components in a language agnostic fashion.

The specification is broken down along those component lines with the following (with links to individual local specification files):

| Component                                        | Description                                     |
