# Smart Social Overview

The goal of the Smart Social Project is to enable a Smart City to communicate with itself.

The populace should be able to Discover, Learn, and Participate in meetups, gatherings, and events, while remaining informed about news and important topics, with location and community awareness in the way information is made available. At the same time, the ability to respond to and share these items will help to complete the social engagement loop, whether between government agencies and the people of Las Vegas, or amongst themselves.

## General Focus Areas

As a preliminary feature set, it makes sense to aim for broadly accepted and long-established tools and platforms that already work. Rather than re-inventing a wheel and asking for yet more user sign-ups, leveraging open protocols and tools, and methods and software people are all likely familiar with, will help to drive early adoption and continued ideation.

This is the *Familiar Surprise* approach.

Basically, if the Smart Social platform can leverage tools already in use, established, tried-and-true, we can add features and functionality to existing platforms and enhance expectations rather than subverting them.

## Inspiration

[Raymon Loewy - MAYA - Familiar Surprise](https://uxdesign.cc/most-advanced-yet-acceptable-theory-meets-digital-product-innovation-f14897147dd5)

    “To sell something surprising, make it familiar; to sell something familiar, make it surprising.”
